# INCOMPLETE One-Factor Black Scholes
 C++ framework implementing Black Scholes EQN using finite difference method allowing individuals to numerically price an option.
---
## Focus
 - One-factor models; therefore, assume initial boundary value problems for second order parabolic differential equations in one space dimension.
